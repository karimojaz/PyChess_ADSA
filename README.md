# PyChess_ADSA
A python chess game with AI

PyChess is a pygame chess game, designed for an Algorithm and Data structures courses project.
This scholar project was made in december 2017, by ESILV students Karim MOUADDEL (https://github.com/karimojaz) and
Victor QUERETTE (https://github.com/victorqrt).

PyChess only depends on Python3 and pygame. However, we highly recommend you run it on PyPy (https://pypy.org) for performance reasons
regarding the AI.
